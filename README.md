# CSRBOX ML Internship 🤖📊

This repository contains the work completed during my **Machine Learning Internship at CSRBOX**. The project explores different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and techniques for solving real-world data problems. It demonstrates how to build and evaluate various models, from data preprocessing to model training.

## 🚀 **What is Machine Learning?**
Machine Learning (ML) is a field of AI (Artificial Intelligence) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML helps solve problems like classification, regression, clustering, and more!

## 📊 **Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing is a critical step in ML to clean and format data before feeding it into algorithms. The following steps were performed:
- **Handling missing values** ❓
- **Feature encoding** (e.g., One-hot encoding for categorical variables) 🔢
- **Feature scaling** (e.g., Normalization and Standardization) ⚖️
- **Splitting data** into training and testing sets for validation 🔀

## 📚 **ML Algorithms Implemented**

### 1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- A simple and effective classification algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority vote of its neighbors.
- Ideal for classification tasks 🏷️.

### 2. **Logistic Regression**
- Used for binary classification (0 or 1 outcomes).
- Models the probability of an event occurring, such as churn prediction or disease diagnosis 💻.

### 3. **Multiple Linear Regression**
- Predicts a continuous target variable based on multiple features (independent variables).
- Helps in tasks like predicting house prices based on multiple features (size, location, etc.) 🏡.

### 4. **Polynomial Regression**
- Extends linear regression by fitting a polynomial equation to the data for capturing non-linear relationships 🔧.
- Useful when data shows a curved trend 📈.

### 5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- A powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
- Works well in high-dimensional spaces and is suitable for both linear and non-linear data 🛠️.

## 🧑‍💻 **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CSRBOX-ML-Internship.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the scripts**:
   - Start by exploring the data preprocessing notebook.
   - Then, move to the algorithm notebooks (KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.).
   - Evaluate the performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score 📉.

## 📈 **Performance Evaluation**
Each algorithm is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy** 📊
- **Confusion Matrix** 🧩
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** 🏅

## 📝 **Conclusion**
This internship project has helped me understand the complete machine learning pipeline, from **data preprocessing** to **model evaluation**. It also provided hands-on experience with various algorithms to solve classification and regression problems.
